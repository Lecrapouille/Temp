// ****************************************************************************
//! \file
//! \brief Values that several programs read from the same memory.
//!
//! A uniform set with Program::set() belongs to one program: three programs
//! needing the same projection matrix means three calls, and three copies the
//! driver keeps. A uniform block is one buffer, written once, bound to a numbered
//! point, and read by every program declaring a block on that point. That is what
//! makes a frame of several passes cheap, and it is what 06_MultiPassMesh shows.
//!
//! There are two ways to fill one, and the difference between them is the whole
//! subject of this file.
//!
//! **Member by member, at the offsets the driver reports.** Always correct,
//! because the offsets are the driver's own answer rather than a computation, and
//! every write is checked against the type the shader declares:
//! \code
//! GPU_TRY_ASSIGN(block, gpu::UniformBlock::create(program, "Matrices"));
//! GPU_TRY(block.set("projection", projection));
//! GPU_TRY(block.set("view", view));
//! GPU_TRY(block.bind());
//! \endcode
//!
//! **By copying a C++ struct whole.** One memcpy rather than a lookup per member,
//! which is what a block rewritten every frame wants, and which is only safe if
//! the struct is laid out the way the shading language reads it:
//! \code
//! struct Matrices
//! {
//!     Matrix44f projection;
//!     Matrix44f view;
//! };
//! GPU_STD140(Matrices, projection, view);
//!
//! GPU_TRY_ASSIGN(block,
//!                gpu::TypedUniformBlock<Matrices>::create(program, "Matrices"));
//! block.modify().projection = projection;
//! GPU_TRY(block.bind());
//! \endcode
//!
//! The typed one is checked twice, and the two checks catch different mistakes.
//! GPU_STD140 refuses at compile time a struct whose members C++ and the std140
//! rules do not put in the same places, which is the mistake of writing the struct
//! carelessly. create() then compares the struct against the offsets this
//! particular driver reports, which is the mistake of assuming the rules were
//! followed. The first names a line of C++; the second names a member and two
//! numbers.

//! \brief A block filled member by member, at the offsets the driver reports.
//!
//! The safe one, and the one to reach for first. Every set() asks the reflection

//! vec3 into a mat4, or writing a member that does not exist, is a sentence rather
//! than a wrong image.
