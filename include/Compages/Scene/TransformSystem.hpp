//! \brief Turns local TRS values into up-to-date world matrices.
//!
//! Walks the graph parents-before-children and recomputes the world matrix of
//! every node whose local pose changed or whose ancestor's pose changed. Nodes
//! that stay dirty because their ancestor changed are marked dirty in the same
//! pass, so the walk itself is what makes the descendant propagation work: no
//! separate up-front sweep of the graph.
//!
//! The composition is the standard TRS one used by Three.js and Unity:
//! \code
//! WorldMatrix(root)  = LocalMatrix(root)
//! WorldMatrix(child) = WorldMatrix(parent) * LocalMatrix(child)
//! \endcode
//! Scale is included in \c LocalTransform::matrix() and therefore inherited by
//! children through this multiplication.
//!
//! The system is stateless. Two Worlds can share one for as long as one is
//! running \c update() at a time.
