//! \brief The vocabulary of the public API.
//!
//! Every one of these is an enum class of our own, never a value taken from a
//! graphics API. A caller writing gpu::Primitive::Triangles does not learn that
//! it happens to be GL_TRIANGLES today, so the day another backend maps it to
//! something else, no caller changes. The translation lives in exactly one
//! switch per backend, where the compiler can check that no case is missing.

//! \brief What a buffer is going to be used for.
//!
//! The kind is fixed when the buffer is created because the driver wants to know
//! where to put the memory. It also lets the library refuse an obvious mistake,
//! such as drawing indexed geometry from a buffer holding uniforms.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
enum class BufferKind
{
    //! \brief Per vertex data read by a vertex shader.
    Vertex,
    //! \brief Indices into a vertex buffer.
    Index,
    //! \brief A uniform block, read only, small, laid out in std140.
    Uniform,
    //! \brief A shader storage block: large, readable and writable by shaders.
    //! This is what a compute pass works on.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! \brief How often the contents are going to change.
//!
//! This is a promise, not a restriction, and getting it wrong costs speed rather
//! than correctness. Immutable is worth reaching for: it lets the driver place
//! the data in the memory the GPU reads fastest, and it is what geometry loaded
//! once from a file should use.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
enum class BufferUsage
{
    //! \brief Written once when created, never again. The fastest to read.
    Immutable,
    //! \brief Written from the CPU now and then, for instance a matrix that
    //! changes every frame.
    Dynamic,
    //! \brief Written by the GPU itself, by a compute pass or by transform
    //! feedback, and rarely read back.
    Storage,

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! \brief Size of one index in an index buffer.
//!
//! Sixteen bits is enough below 65536 vertices and halves the memory the GPU has
//! to read, which is why it is worth choosing rather than always using 32.
