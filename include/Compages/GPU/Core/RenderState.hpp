//! Whether to test depth, how to blend, which faces to drop: state that used to
//! be set by calling into the graphics API between draws, and therefore state
//! that leaked from one draw to the next. Forgetting to turn depth testing off
//! after a pass left the next one wrong, and the symptom appeared in the pass
//! that was innocent.
//!
//! Here it is a value, fixed when a Pipeline is created and applied whole every
//! time that pipeline is used. There is nothing to restore, because nothing was
//! ever left changed: the next pipeline states its own answer to every question.
