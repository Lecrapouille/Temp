//! \brief What the library is doing and what it is holding.
//!
//! Two kinds of number, and the difference between them is the point.
//!
//! The counts of work are reset every frame and say how much a frame cost: how
//! many draw calls, how many vertices. They are what to look at when a frame is
//! slow.
//!
//! The counts of resources are not reset, because they are not about a frame at
//! all. They say how many handles are alive and how much device memory they add
//! up to, and they should come back to where they started when a demo is closed.
//! An example that leaves them higher than it found them leaked, and the examples
//! gallery shows them continuously for exactly that reason: switching through
//! seventeen demos in a loop without the numbers drifting is the demonstration that
//! handle lifetimes are right.
