// ****************************************************************************
//! \file
//! \brief One complete way of drawing: a program, a vertex layout, and a state.
//!
//! This is where the reversal the whole library is built around actually
//! happens, so it is worth stating plainly.
//!
//! The previous design derived the vertex layout from the shader. A program was
//! introspected, a buffer was created for each attribute it declared, and a VAO
//! belonged to one program forever: `GLProgram::bind(vao)` refused a VAO that had
//! been used with another program. So a mesh could not be drawn twice with two
//! different shaders, which is what a second material, a shadow pass or a
//! wireframe overlay all need.
//!
//! Here the layout is declared in C++, and the shader is only asked to confirm
//! that it can be fed by it. The consequence is the point of the exercise: one
//! Buffer<Vertex> holding position, normal and texture coordinates feeds a
//! forward pass that reads all three and a shadow pass that reads only the
//! position, and neither pass knows about the other. That is example
//! 06_MultiPassMesh.
//!
//! And the confirmation is a real one. A layout offering "aPosition" to a shader
//! declaring "position" used to draw nothing, silently; it is now an error naming
//! both lists. Same for a vec2 field feeding a vec3 attribute, and for whole
//! numbers feeding a float attribute.

namespace gpu
{

//! \brief Names one pipeline.
using PipelineHandle = Handle<struct PipelineTag>;

// ****************************************************************************
//! \brief A program, a vertex layout and a render state, checked against each
//! other once and then never again.
//!
//! Immutable on purpose. Everything that could be wrong about a way of drawing is
//! found out when the pipeline is created, which is at load time, where a message
//! can be read and acted on. Nothing is checked per draw, and nothing can be
//! changed behind a caller's back between two draws.
//!
//! \code
//! struct Vertex
//! {
//!     Vector3f position;
//!     Vector3f normal;
//!     Vector2f uv;
//! };
//!
//! // The layout is read off the struct: position, normal and uv feed the
//! // shader attributes of the same names.
//! COMPAGES_TRY_ASSIGN(m_forward, gpu::Pipeline::create<Vertex>(
//!     m_program, { .depth_test = true, .cull = gpu::CullMode::Back }));
//! \endcode
//!
//! Most code never builds one: gpu::Drawable makes the pipeline it needs from
//! its shader and its vertices. A Pipeline written by hand is for sharing one
//! program between several vertex layouts or render states.
//!
//! \note A pipeline does not own its program: it names it. The program has to
//! outlive it. Releasing the program first is caught rather than crashed on, as
//! a failure the next time the pipeline is used.
