//! \file
//! \brief Where a frame is drawn, and what it starts from.
//!
//! A pass is a span of drawing with one target, one viewport, and one decision
//! about what the target held before. Every draw inside a pass goes to the same
//! place, and a draw outside any pass is a mistake rather than a draw into
//! whatever happened to be bound.
//!
//! In the examples the window already opened a pass over itself before calling
//! draw(), so drawing to the screen needs nothing but the colour to start from:
//! \code
//! gpu::clear({ 0.1f, 0.1f, 0.15f });
//! m_triangle.draw();
//! \endcode
//!
//! Drawing into a texture opens a pass over its framebuffer. Passes nest: the
//! one below is suspended meanwhile and resumed, not cleared, at the end:
//! \code
//! {
//!     gpu::RenderPass offscreen(m_framebuffer, { .color = { 0, 0, 0, 1 } });
//!     m_scene.draw();
//! }                          // back to the window
//! m_screen["image"] = m_color;
//! m_screen.draw(3u);
//! \endcode
//!
//! The pass ends when the object goes out of scope. There is nothing to
//! remember to call, and nothing that stays half open when a frame returns
//! early.
