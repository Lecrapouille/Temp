//! \brief Compute in a texture, by drawing into another.
//!
//! Each cell is a pixel. A shader covering the texture reads the current
//! generation and writes the next into a second texture. The two then swap,
//! which is why this is called ping-pong: a shader cannot read the picture it
//! is writing, so the next generation has to live somewhere else.
//! \code
//! m_step["previous"] = m_field[m_current];
//! {
//!     gpu::RenderPass into(m_target[next], { .clear_color = false });
//!     m_step.draw(3u);
//! }
//! m_current = next;
//! \endcode
//!
//! This is how glumpy computed on the GPU, and it works with nothing but a
//! framebuffer. A compute shader does the same with less ceremony in
//! 12_ComputeParticles.
