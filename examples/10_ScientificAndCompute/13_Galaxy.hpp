//! \brief N-body gravity, tiled shared memory, two buffers that swap.
//!
//! Particles bounced against walls they already knew. These stars pull on
//! every other star, which is why the work is done in tiles loaded into
//! shared memory: each work group reads a slice once and reuses it, the
//! way GPU Gems 3 taught.
//!
//! A PingPong is two storage buffers: this frame's output is next frame's
//! input. The drawable is told each frame which of the two to read, which
//! costs nothing:
//! \code
//! m_stars.swap();
//! m_points.vertices(m_stars.input());
//! m_points.draw();
//! \endcode
