//! \brief A terrain coloured by a 3D texture: six pictures stacked, from deep
//! water to snow, and the altitude picks where to read between them.
//!
//! A 3D texture is sampled with three coordinates. The first two say where on
//! a picture, the third says between which pictures, and the hardware blends
//! the two nearest. The altitude of each vertex becomes that third
//! coordinate, so the shore fades into fields and the rocks into snow without
//! any test in the shader:
//! \code
//! COMPAGES_TRY(m_layers.loadVolume({ "deep_water.png", ..., "snow.png" }));
//! m_terrain["layers"] = m_layers;         // a sampler3D in the shader
//! \endcode
