//! \brief The same ping-pong, with numbers that are not colours.
//!
//! Game of Life stored a bit per cell. This stores two concentrations as
//! 32-bit floats, because a reaction-diffusion is an equation, not a rule.
//! RGBA32F is what says so: the texture holds values, and the display pass
//! turns them into a picture afterwards.
//!
//! Two chemicals, U and V. U is fed, V is killed, and where they meet they
//! make more V. The patterns that grow from a seed in the middle are why
//! people keep writing this equation.
