// ****************************************************************************
//! \file
//! \brief Every example, in one program.
//!
//! Run it with no argument to start at the first one, or with the name of an
//! example to start there:
//! \code
//! ./build/Compages-examples 04_DepthAndTransforms
//! ./build/Compages-examples --check
//! \endcode
//!
//! With --check, every example is built, drawn for a few frames and closed, and
//! the program fails if any of them could not run or left anything behind on
//! the device. That is a leak test as much as a smoke test, and it is the
//! reason all of the examples are one program rather than seventeen.
//!
//! The examples are meant to be read in order. Each one adds a single idea to
//! the one before it, and says in its own comments which idea that is and why
//! it is there.
