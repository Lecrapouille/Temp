// ****************************************************************************
//! \brief A solid in three dimensions: indices, depth, culling and matrices.
//!
//! Everything the previous four examples left out arrives at once, because these
//! four things are what turn a flat picture into a solid and they are useless one
//! at a time.
//!
//! Indices, so that a corner shared by several triangles is stored once and named
//! several times. Depth testing, so that a face nearer the eye covers one further
//! away whatever order they were drawn in. Back face culling, so that half the
//! triangles of a closed shape are dropped before they cost anything. And three
//! matrices, so that a shape described once can be placed, looked at, and
//! projected.
//!
//! The depth test and the culling live in the render state of the drawable:
//! \code
//! m_cube.depthTest().cull(gpu::CullMode::Back);
//! \endcode
//! They are not switched on before the draw and forgotten afterwards: two
//! drawables wanting different ones cannot leave the device in a state the
//! other did not ask for.
//!
//! The cube itself, twenty four corners and thirty six indices, is built by
//! createCube() in Common/ColoredCube.hpp, shared with the 05 examples.
