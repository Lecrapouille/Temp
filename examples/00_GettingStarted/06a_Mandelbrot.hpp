//! \brief A picture with no mesh at all.

//! The vertex shader builds a triangle covering the target from the index of
//! the vertex it is running for. There is no buffer, no layout and no upload,
//! which is what every fullscreen effect wants: the work is in the fragment
//! shader, and a vertex would only be something to forget to update.
//!
//! The mouse is the point the zoom keeps still. Moving it chooses a place in
//! the complex plane; time closes in on it. That is a uniform changing every
//! frame, not a vertex moving.
