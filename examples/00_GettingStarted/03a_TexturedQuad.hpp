//! \brief A texture read by a shader, and a strip instead of separate triangles.
//!
//! The texture is computed here rather than read from a file, so that the example
//! depends on nothing outside itself and so that its content is knowable: a
//! checkerboard, with a gradient over it. Reading a file is one call away, and
//! Texture::fromFile() is what 09_HeightMap uses.
//!
//! Uniforms and textures are given by name, with the same syntax as the
//! attributes of 01b: the shader says which is which.
//! \code
//! m_quad["scale"] = 2.0f;        // a uniform, written immediately
//! m_quad["image"] = m_texture;   // a sampler: a texture unit is picked for it
//! \endcode
//! The four corners are drawn as a triangle strip: the primitive belongs to the
//! render state of the drawable, not to each draw.
