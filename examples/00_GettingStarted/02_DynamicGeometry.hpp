//! \brief Vertices that move, sent as cheaply as they can be.
//!
//! A gpu::Drawable keeps its vertices on the CPU and notices which ones were
//! written: those, and only those, travel to the device on the next draw.
//! Here the apex of the triangle follows the mouse and the two feet never
//! move, so one vertex out of three is sent per frame:
//! \code
//! m_triangle.vertex<Vertex>(APEX).position = p_frame.mouseInClipSpace();
//! m_triangle.draw();   // sends that vertex, then draws
//! \endcode
//!
//! That is the shape of every demo computing something on the CPU and showing
//! it: a curve being integrated, a mesh being deformed, a plot growing a point
//! at a time (emplace_back() works too).
