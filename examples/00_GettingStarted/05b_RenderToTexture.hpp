//! \brief A picture drawn into textures, then read as a picture.
//!
//! The window is one target. A framebuffer is another: colour and depth textures
//! wired together so that a pass writes into them instead of onto the screen.
//! The cube of 05 is drawn only there. The window never sees it as a mesh; it
//! sees the texture that pass produced, once as it is and once through a
//! fullscreen effect.
//!
//! \code
//! {
//!     gpu::RenderPass offscreen(m_target);   // over the window pass
//!     m_cube.draw();
//! }                                          // back to the window
//! m_screen.draw(3u);                         // samples m_color
//! \endcode
//!
//! The textures are named by the framebuffer, not owned: destroying it does
//! not destroy the images, which is why the screen can still sample them. And
//! the offscreen picture is a size of its own, not the size of the window.
