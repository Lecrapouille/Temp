// ****************************************************************************
//! \brief The triangle of 01b_Triangle, from a C++ struct.
//!
//! When vertices are computed rather than typed, a struct is their natural
//! shape. Nothing has to describe it: its fields are read off the struct by
//! the compiler, name, type and offset, and matched to the shader attributes
//! by name. A field named otherwise than the attribute it feeds is renamed:
//! \code
//! m_triangle.vertices<Vertex>(corners,
//!     gpu::VertexLayout::of<Vertex>().rename("position", "aPosition"));
//! \endcode
//!
//! These vertices never change, so they go straight into a buffer made
//! with gpu::BufferUsage::Immutable: filled once when it is created, which
//! lets the driver keep it where the GPU reads fastest, and never written
//! again. The drawable reads that buffer where it is rather than keeping a
//! copy of its own:
//! \code
//! COMPAGES_TRY_ASSIGN(m_vertices, gpu::Buffer<Vertex>::from(corners,
//!     { .usage = gpu::BufferUsage::Immutable, .cpu_mirror = false }));
//! m_triangle.vertices(m_vertices);
//! \endcode
//! 02_DynamicGeometry does the opposite: vertices that change every frame.
