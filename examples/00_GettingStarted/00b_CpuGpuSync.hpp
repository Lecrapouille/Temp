//! \brief Two copies of the same numbers: one on the CPU, one on the GPU.
//!
//! The graphics card has a memory of its own. A gpu::Buffer keeps a copy of
//! its elements on the CPU, used like a std::vector, and remembers which ones
//! were changed since they were last sent:
//! \code
//! m_values.assign({ 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 });   // on the CPU only
//! m_values[2u] = 42;                      // still on the CPU only
//! COMPAGES_TRY(m_values.upload());         // now on the GPU too
//! \endcode
//! The bars are what the GPU holds, read back from it. The buttons of the
//! "Try it" panel change the CPU copy: the bars turn orange where the two copies
//! disagree, and catch up when upload() is pressed. A drawable does that
//! upload itself at every draw, which is why no later example calls it.
