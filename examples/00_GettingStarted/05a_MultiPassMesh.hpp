//! exists: Program::set() would have copied them three times, into three places
//! the driver keeps.
//!
//! GPU_STD140 is at file scope on purpose. It specialises a template in
//! gpu::std140, which a type hidden in a class or an anonymous namespace cannot
//! do, and the compiler would then treat the struct as never described.

// ****************************************************************************
//! \brief One mesh, three ways of drawing it, one block of matrices: the level
//! beneath gpu::Drawable.
//!
//! A Drawable owns its shader and its vertices. When one mesh is drawn by
//! several shaders, the pieces are held apart instead: one Buffer<Vertex>, one
//! Program per way of drawing, and one Pipeline per program, which checks at
//! set up that the vertex can feed that shader:
//! \code
//! COMPAGES_TRY(m_lit_program.load(LIT_VERTEX, LIT_FRAGMENT));
//! COMPAGES_TRY_ASSIGN(m_lit, gpu::Pipeline::create<Vertex>(m_lit_program, solid));
//! ...
//! gpu::drawIndexed(m_lit, m_vertices, m_indices);
//! \endcode
//! The lit pass reads every field, the normals pass drops the colour the
//! linker never needed, the wireframe drops both; the overlay's vertex-reader
//! count is what says the buffer really is shared.
//!
//! The matrices are a typed uniform block. Written once per frame, bound once,
//! read by all three programs from the same numbered point.
