//! \brief The whole of a frame, with nothing drawn in it.
//!
//! What this shows is a pass: where in the window a frame goes, and what it starts
//! from. Two of them, in fact, one into each half of the window, because the
//! second one is what makes it clear that a pass is a region and not "the screen".
//!
//! What it does not show is any resource at all. Watching the counters in the
//! overlay stay at zero while this runs is the point: clearing the window costs
//! nothing and holds nothing.
