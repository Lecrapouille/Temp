//! \file
//! \brief Writing an image file, which the library does not do either.
//!
//! Reading an image is part of the library because a texture has to come from
//! somewhere. Writing one is not: nothing in a renderer needs it, and the only
//! reason the examples want it is to make the pictures in the documentation.
//!
//! It lives in its own translation unit because it carries a single file library
//! with it, and third party code is worth keeping to one place where the warnings
//! it produces can be turned off without turning them off for our own code.
