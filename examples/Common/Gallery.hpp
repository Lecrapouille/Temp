//! \file
//! \brief One program holding every example, switched without restarting.
//!
//! There is one binary rather than forty, for a reason that is not laziness:
//! switching from one example to the next inside a live device is what proves
//! the resources of the one being left are actually given back. The panels
//! show the counters of the device next to the counters of the frame, so a
//! leak shows up as a number that does not come back down when an example is
//! closed.
//!
//! The window is laid out like an editor, every panel docked and movable:
//!
//! - **Viewport**, in the middle: the example, drawn into a texture of the
//!   size of the panel, so that no panel ever hides part of it. Mouse and
//!   keyboard go to the example while the pointer is over it or it has focus.
//! - **Examples**, on the left: the list, by chapter, with a mark on those
//!   that failed or leaked.
//! - **Inspector**, **Source** and **Debug**, on the right: what the example
//!   shows, its code, and the switches of the debug mode (pause, one frame at
//!   a time, wireframe, keep drawing after an error...).
//! - **Console**, at the bottom: every message of the library and the driver,
//!   each said once with a count.
//!
//! An example is built only when it is chosen. Nothing is on the device for
//! the examples nobody is looking at.
