// ****************************************************************************
//! \file
//! \brief What every example is, seen from the gallery.
//!
//! Four things: a name, a sentence saying what it demonstrates, a way to set
//! itself up, and a way to draw one frame. A fifth, optional, puts a few
//! controls of its own into the "Try it" panel. Everything else, the window,
//! the loop, the timing, the overlay, belongs to the gallery.
//!
//! There is deliberately no tear down. An example holds its resources as members,
//! and destroying it releases them, which is the same rule as everywhere else in
//! the library. That is also what makes the gallery a leak test: if closing an
//! example does not bring the resource counters back to where they were, the
//! example is holding something it should not, and the overlay shows it
//! immediately.
// ****************************************************************************

//! \brief What the gallery tells an example about the frame it draws: the
//! size, the time and the input. \c total restarts when the example is chosen.

// ****************************************************************************
//! \brief One demonstration, of one idea.
//!
//! Each example demonstrates a point about the design rather than a function of
//! the graphics API, which is why the description is part of the interface: the
//! gallery shows it, and writing it is how the author of an example checks it has
//! a point.

    //! to the screen needs no pass of its own: gpu::clear() then draw.
    //! Whatever goes wrong is the frame error (see gpu/Errors.hpp), which the
    //! gallery reads after the frame: it stops the example and shows the
    //! reason rather than repeating the same failure sixty times a second.
    //!
    //! \param[in] p_frame the size of the window and how much time has passed.
